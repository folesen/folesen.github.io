I live in the rural north of Hong Kong where the wildlife and landscapes are beautiful and biodiverse. After two years of living in my village, I began to realise certain changes going on in the village. More houses were being built, habitats were getting destroyed and less wildlife was present in and around my area. This inspsired me to try and organise a form of CAS project to try and revive the wildlife of Hong Kong. Since then I have been organising weekly clean ups of hiking trails and beaches around Hong Kong to try and stem the tide of litter that pollutes the countryside.</b></p><br/>
                <p class="body"><b>There is a tone of stuff that you can do to help me me out along with the friends I have gethered along this journey. I am organising three cleanups on the first three weekends of June before we all go on summer holiday. Please join in and help save our environment one step at a time!</b></p><br/>
